# TraceLink Opus Platform Code Samples  

## Communicating with Agile Process Teams using code  

This repository provides developers with code samples for interacting with TraceLink's Agile Process Teams (APT) app.

APT is a multienterprise work management app that allows Owners to collaborate with cross-enterprise
and cross-functional trade partners throughout the supply chain by digitally executing, managing, and tracking shared
business processes, which increases speed and improves the effectiveness of the supply chain. Agile Process Teams allows
companies to create multiple networks that use the following processes for this digital collaboration:

- Incidents: Direct Supplier, Indirect Supplier
- Incidents: External Manufacturing, Internal Manufacturing
- Change Requests
- Tasks

Currently, our API only have supports incident management. Additional functionality is coming soon and will be added
to this repository.

## Prerequisites

Your company must have licenses for the Suppy Chain Work Management solution and APT app.

## Languages
Samples focus on basic actions using the most common scripting languages. These samples are organized in folders by language.  
Folders are added as the language samples become available.
